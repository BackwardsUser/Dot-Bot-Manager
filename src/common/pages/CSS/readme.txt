If you are planning on creating your own theme please note, I didn't make it easy. If you want to make your own from
scratch just keep in mind that you will have to make an entire CSS page, for each page that exists. I have limited
the number of pages that exist, however, it is still a long process. Feel free to take a look at the existing themes.

Also please take a look at the theme example in the README on the github to get approximately how a styles addon
should look.

Thanks!

-- IMPORTANT
Leave the purple styles: "purple", "darker-purple"; as they are (Changing them won't break anything) used as
background and border for the bouncing icon as the image's outline is a little thinner than I would have liked, so
I fixed it using CSS border.
